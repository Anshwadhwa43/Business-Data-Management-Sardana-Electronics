# Business Data Management Project â€“ Sardana Electronics

## Overview
This project is part of my **academic curriculum** for Business Data Management. It focuses on **analyzing real-world business data** collected from **Sardana Electronics**, a shop located in **Rania, Sirsa, Haryana**.  

The **goal of this project** is to **solve real business problems** by analyzing sales, inventory, and operational data, identifying patterns and inefficiencies, and providing actionable insights to support **data-driven decision making**.  

The analysis leverages **Python, statistical techniques, data visualization, and basic machine learning**.

## Business Problems Solved
The project addresses key challenges faced by the shop:

1. **Fluctuating Sales Patterns:**  
   Due to variations in customer demand, it is difficult to maintain an **optimal inventory**. The shop often experiences **overstocking of some products** and **running out of others**, leading to **increased holding costs** and **missed sales opportunities**.  

2. **High Product Return Rates:**  
   Certain products have a **higher than average return rate**, negatively affecting the shop's reputation and profitability. The project identifies the **root causes of these returns** to minimize their impact on the business.  

By solving these issues, the project helps the shop make **better inventory decisions**, **reduce costs**, and **improve overall business performance**.
